 * the length of some logical levels >=500us. This happens
 * because of the race conditions between logicalOne() and logicalZero()
 * goroutines. The race condition means that the order of execution
 * of the instructions of two threads/goroutines is unpredictable.
 * Even logicalOne() starts first and both logicalOne() and
 * logicalZero() have 500us sleep, Go Runtime can execute logicalZero()
 * first and/or switch between logicalOne() and logicalZero()
 * goroutines unpredictably.
